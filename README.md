# MATHEMATICAL REASONING 

## Overview
This project aims to leverage [Universal Transformers](https://github.com/andreamad8/Universal-Transformer-Pytorch) to solve a range of mathematical problems. Given a math question as the input, the model should generate the mathematical solution. We seek to explore UT's recursive processing abilities as well as enhancing its performance.
